## Installation

Provided an appropriate environment installation should be as simple as a
`pip install`.

However, on some systems there are interactions with `casacore` and building
`python-casacore` appropriately. Issues have been noted when interacting with
large measurement sets across components with different `casacore` versions.
This seems to happen even across container boundaries (i.e. different versions
in containers might play a role). The exact cause is not at all understood, but
it appears to be related to the version of `python-casacore`, `numpy` and
whether pre-built wheels are used.

In practise it might be easier to leverage `conda` to install the appropriate
`boost` and `casacore` libraries.

A helpful script below may be of use.

```

BRANCH="main" # replace this with appropriate branch or tag
DIR="flint_${BRANCH}"
PYVERSION="3.12"

mkdir "${DIR}" || exit
cd "${DIR}" || exit


git clone git@github.com:tjgalvin/flint.git && \
        cd flint && \
        git checkout "${BRANCH}"

conda create -y  -n "${DIR}" python="${PYVERSION}" &&  \
        source /home/$(whoami)/.bashrc && \
        conda activate "${DIR}" && \
        conda install -y -c conda-forge boost casacore && \
        PIP_NO_BINARY="python-casacore" pip install -e .
```

This may set up an appropriate environment that is compatible with the
containers currently being used.

### The error

The error looked something like this:

```
An unhandled exception occurred: FiledesIO::read /path/to/data.ms/table.mf - read returned a bad value
```

## About

This `flint` package is trying to get a minimum start-to-finish calibration and
imaging workflow written for `RACS` style ASKAP data. `python` functions are
used to do the work, and `prefect` is used to orchestrate their usage into a
larger pipeline.

Most of the `python` routines have a CLI that can be used to test them in a
piecewise sense. These entry points are installed as programs available on the
command line. They are listed below with a brief description:

- `flint_skymodel`: derives a sky-model using a reference catalogue suitable to
  perform bandpass calibration against. Note that it is not "science quality" as
  it assumes an ideal primary beam response and the reference catalogues do not
  incorporate spectral information.
- `flint_aocalibrate`: Performs amplitude and phase calibration against a
  sky-model, intended for bandpass calibration, and leverage's Andre Offringa's
  `calibrate` program.
- `flint_flagger`: Performs basic flagging on an input measurement set.
- `flint_bandpass`: A small workflow to bandpass calibrate ASKAP measurement
  sets that have observed PKS B1934-638.
- `flint_ms`: Utility functions related to inspecting and pre-processing an
  ASKAP measurement set.
- `flint_wsclean`: Uses `wsclean` to image and clean an ASKAP measurement set
  with pre-defined options.
- `flint_gaincal`: Uses the `casa` task `gaincal` and `applysolutions` to
  perform self-calibration of an ASKAP measurement set.
- `flint_convol`: Convols a collection of images to a common resolution.
- `flint_yandalinmos`: Will co-add a collection of images of a single field
  together, optionally including holography measurements.
- `flint_config`: The beginnings of a configuration-based scheme to specify
  options throughout a workflow.
- `flint_aegean`: Simple interface to execute BANE and aegean against a provided
  image. These tools are expected to be packaged in a singularity container.
- `flint_validation_plot`: Create a simple, quick look figure that expresses the
  key quality statistics of an image. It is intended to be used against a full
  continuum field image, but in-principal be used for a per beam image.
- `flint_potato`: Attempt to peel out known sources from a measurement set using
  [potatopeel](https://gitlab.com/Sunmish/potato/-/tree/main). Criteria used to
  assess which sources to peel is fairly minimumal, and at the time of writing
  only the reference set of sources packaged within `flint` are
  considered. -`flint_archive`: Operations around archiving and copying final
  data products into place. -`flint_catalogue`: Download reference catalogues
  that are expected by `flint`

The following commands use the `prefect` framework to link together individual
tasks together (outlined above) into a single data-processing pipeline.

- `flint_flow_bandpass_calibrate`: Executes a prefect flow run that will
  calibrate a set of ASKAP measurement sets taken during a normal bandpass
  observation sequence.
- `flint_flow_continuum_pipeline`: Performs bandpass calibration, solution
  copying, imaging, self-calibration and mosaicing.
- `flint_flow_cointinuum_mask_pipeline`: Performs bandpass calibration, solution
  copying, imaging, self-calibration and mosaicing. In this flow a process to
  construct a robust clean mask is performed by exploiting an initial imaging
  round. The field image is constructed across all beams, S/N clipping is
  performed, then guard masks on a per-beam basis are extracted. This pipeline
  has fallen out of use and could be removed.

## Sky-model catalogues

The `flint_skymodel` command will attempt to create an in-field sky-model for a
particular measurement set using existing source catalogues and an idealised
primary beam response. 'Supported' catalogues are those available through
`flint_catalogue download`. Note this mode has not be thoroughly tested and may
not be out-of-date relative to how the `flint_flow_continuum_pipeline` operates.
In the near future this may be expanded.

If calibrating a bandpass (i.e. `1934-638`) `flint` will use the packaged source
model. At the moment this is only provided for `calibrate`.

## About ASKAP Measurement Sets

Some of the innovative components of ASKAP and the `yandasoft` package have
resulted in measurement sets that are not immediately inline with external
tools. Measurement sets should first be processed with
[fixms](https://github.com/AlecThomson/FixMS). Be careful -- most (all) `flint`
tasks don't currently do this automatically. Be aware, me hearty.

## Containers

At the moment this toy pipeline uses `singularity` containers to use compiled
software that are outside the `python` ecosystem. For the moment there are no
'supported' container packaged with this repository -- sorry!

In a nutshell, the containers used throughout are passed in as command line
arguments, whose context should be enough to explain what it is expecting. At
the time of writing there are six containers for:

- calibration: this should contain `calibrate` and `applysolutions`. These are
  tools written by Andre Offringa.
- flagging: this should contain `aoflagger`, which is installable via a
  `apt install aoflagger` within ubunutu.
- imaging: this should contain `wsclean`. This should be at least version 3. At
  the moment a modified version is being used (which implements a
  `-force-mask-round` option).
- source finding: `aegeam` is used for basic component catalogue creation. It is
  not intedended to be used to produce final source catalogues, but to help
  construct quick-look data products. A minimal set of `BANE` and `aegean`
  options are used.
- source peeling: `potatopeel` is a package that uses `wsclean`, `casa` and a
  customisable rule set to peel out troublesome annoying objects. Although it is
  a python installable and importable package, there are potential conflicts
  with the `python-casacore` modules that `flint` uses. See
  [potatopeel's github repository for more information](https://gitlab.com/Sunmish/potato/-/tree/main)
- linear mosaicing: The `linmos` task from `yandasoft` is used to perform linear
  mosaicing. Importanting this `linmos` is capable of using the ASKAP primary
  beam responses characterised through holography. `yandasoft` docker images
  [are available from the CSIRO dockerhub page.](https://hub.docker.com/r/csirocass/askapsoft).
- self-calibration: `casa` is used to perform antenna-based self-calibration.
  Specifically the tasks `gaincal`, `applysolutions`, `cvel` and `mstransform`
  are used throughout this process. Careful selection of an appropriate CASA
  version should be made to keep the `casacore` library in compatible state with
  other components. Try the `docker://alecthomson/casa:ks9-5.8.0` image.

## Configuration based settings

Most settings within `flint` are stored in immutable option classes, e.g.
`WSCleanOptions`, `GainCalOptions`. Once they such an option class has been
created, any new option values may only be set by creating a new instance. In
such cases there is an appropriate `.with_options` method that might be of use.
This 'nothing changes unless explicitly done so' was adopted early as a way to
avoid confusing when moving to a distributed multi-node execution environment.

The added benefit is that it has defined very clear interfaces into key stages
throughout `flint`s calibration and imaging stages. The `flint_config` program
can be used to create template `yaml` file that lists default values of these
option classes that are expected to be user-tweakable, and provides the ability
to change values of options throughout initial imaging and subsequent rounds of
self-calibration.

In a nutshell, the _currently_ supported option classes that may be tweaked
through this template method are:

- `WSCleanOptions` (shorthand `wsclean`)
- `GainCalOptions` (shorthand `gaincal`)
- `MaskingOptions` (shorthand `masking`)
- `ArchiveOptions` (shorthand `archive`)
- `BANEOptions` (shorthand `bane`)
- `AegeanOptions` (shorthand `aegean`)

All attributed supported by these options may be set in this template format.
Not that these options would have to be retrieved within a particular flow and
passed to the appropriate functions - they are not (currently) automatically
accessed.

The `defaults` scope sets all of the default values of these classes. The
`initial` scope overrides the default imaging `wsclean` options to be used with
the first round of imaging _before self-calibration_.

The `selfcal` scope contains a key-value mapping, where an `integer` key relates
the options to that specific round of masking, imaging and calibration options
for that round of self-calibration. Again, options set here override the
corresponding options defined in the `defaults` scope.

`flint_config` can be used to generate a template file, which can then be
tweaked. The template file uses YAML to define scope and settings. So, use the
YAML standard when modifying this file. There are primitive verification
functions to ensure the modified template file is correctly form.

## CLI Configuration file

To help manage (and avoid) long CLI calls to configure `flint`, most command
line options may be dumped into a new-line delimited text file which can then be
set as the `--cli-config` option of some workflows. See the `configargparse`
python utility to read up on more on how options may be overridden if specified
in both the text file and CLI call.

## Validation Plots

The validation plots that are created are simple and aim to provide a quality
assessment at a quick glance. An RMS image and corresponding source component
catalogue are the base data products derived from the ASKAP data that are
supplied to the routine.

`flint` requires a set of reference catalogues to be present for some stages of
operation, the obvious being the validation plots described above. In some
computing environments (e.g. HPC) network access to external services are
blocked. To avoid these issues `flint` has a built in utility to download the
reference catalogues it expected from vizier and write them to a specified user
directory. See:

> `flint_catalogue download --help`

The parent directory that contains these cataloguues should be provided to the
appropriate tasks when appropriate.

In the current `flint` package these catalogues (and their expected columns)
are:

- ICRF

```
Catalogue(
    survey="ICRF",
    file_name="ICRF.fits",
    freq=1e9,
    ra_col="RAJ2000",
    dec_col="DEJ2000",
    name_col="ICRF",
    flux_col="None",
    maj_col="None",
    min_col="None",
    pa_col="None",
    vizier_id="I/323/icrf2",
)
```

- NVSS

```
Catalogue(
    survey="NVSS",
    file_name="NVSS.fits",
    name_col="NVSS",
    freq=1.4e9,
    ra_col="RAJ2000",
    dec_col="DEJ2000",
    flux_col="S1.4",
    maj_col="MajAxis",
    min_col="MinAxis",
    pa_col="PA",
    vizier_id="VIII/65/nvss",
)
```

- SUMSS

```
Catalogue(
    survey="SUMSS",
    file_name="SUMSS.fits",
    freq=8.43e8,
    ra_col="RAJ2000",
    dec_col="DEJ2000",
    name_col="Mosaic",
    flux_col="St",
    maj_col="dMajAxis",
    min_col="dMinAxis",
    pa_col="dPA",
    vizier_id="VIII/81B/sumss212",
)
```

- RACS-LOW

```
Catalogue(
    file_name="racs-low.fits",
    survey="RACS-LOW",
    freq=887.56e6,
    ra_col="RAJ2000",
    dec_col="DEJ2000",
    name_col="GID",
    flux_col="Ftot",
    maj_col="amaj",
    min_col="bmin",
    pa_col="PA",
    vizier_id="J/other/PASA/38.58/gausscut",
)
```

The known filename is used to find the appropriate catalogue and its full path,
and are appropriately named when using the `flint_catalogue download` tool.
